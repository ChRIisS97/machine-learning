# --------------------- machine-learning ------------------------- 

In the Colorpicker project, any RGB color is entered and
the program adds two matching colors. 
Unlike conventional color pickers, this is not programmed based on rules, but is based on a neural net.
The Colorpicker is based on the Javascript Library Brain JS.
The neural net was trained with several color harmonies, each consisting of three colors. 
One color was chosen as input and two harmonizing colors as output.
These color combinations were determined with Adobe Color CC. 
The color data set was divided into saturated colors, medium saturated colors and unsaturated colors.
